# Time
A tool to help a confused and tired Dan (and now maybe other people) with timezones.

**Disclaimer** Time only contains my own code and was written in my own time. No data or information from my employer (past or present) is contained within this repo. CyberSec - you can relax, these are not the breaches you are looking for. \[/end disclaimer]

Basically, I've started a new task at work that involves needing to be hyper aware of different time zones. I made a basic rough and ready version of this project in order to make sure I was able to keep track of the time in the US for things like lunch or meetings. I've since come to the conclusion that a finished version of this would be helpful for the future, as well as for other people either at work or elsewhere.
